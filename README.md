Instructions

After downloading all three files from the repository, make sure that you have the turtle module installed as well.
To activate, please run python3 mandelbrot_set_v2.0.py in the terminal. Make sure the three files are in the same directory.
The fractal image will take roughly a minute to generate.

To move, zoom, or enhance the image, use the following key bindings:

"J" to display the square cursor

"WASD" to move the cursor in small increments
"TFGH" to move the cursor in large increments

"K" is to increase the size of the cursor
"L" is to decrease the size of the cursor

"O" is to increase the resolution the fractal
"P" is to decrease the resolution the fractal

"U" is to zoom into the fractal contained within the cursor
"I" is to reset the viewer to default settings
